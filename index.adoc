== Experience in JSON or XML?

* No prior knowledge of JSON and XML is required.
* No programming knowledge is required.

> You will gain a lot from this session if you understand JSON and XML.

[.columns]
== Structured vs. Unstructured Data: Whatâ€™s the Difference?

[.column.is-half]
.Structured data

* Structured data is data that is organized in a predefined way, such as in a table or spreadsheet.
* It is easy to search and analyze structured data because it has a clear and defined structure.
* JSON and XML are both examples of structured data formats.

[.column.is-half]
.Unstructured data

* Unstructured data is data that is not organized in a predefined way.
* It can be text, images, audio, or video.
* Unstructured data is more difficult to search and analyze than structured data because it does not have a clear and defined structure.


=== What are JSON and XML?

* JSON and XML are both text-based data formats that can be used to store structured data.
* JSON is a lightweight format that is easy to read and write.
* XML is a more complex format that offers more flexibility.

== Data types and strcutured data
* Numbers: integer and decimal (floating) numbers
* Text
* True or False statements
* Custom types

=== Data types in JOSN
* JSON has three data types

> Number, Strings, and Booleans

=== Data types in XML
* XML has only one data types

> Strings

== Strings
* Text group together inside single or double quotes ("string")
* Can have anything, from letter to numbers, to punctutation marks
* Can have spaces

> Example -> "tribe", "API documentation", "2"

== Boolean
*  Math with logic
*  Boolean has only two values:
** True
** False


== Vizualizing data types

== Collections

* Structured data can have groups of data:
** Arrays (lists)
** Dictionaries (lookup tables)

=== Arrays
List of data values

* It has:
** A size
** An order

> Example, list of numbers -> 5, 3, -7, 9
> list of strings -> "tribe", "API documentation", "2"

=== Dictionaries
Collection of data keys and values.

* A key is used to look up a value, just like a dictionary

> Example -> A collection of Indian states with geo location. 
> "Uttar Pradesh": 10

=== Summary
Structured data can have:

[.column]
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Dictionaries of lists
* Lists of dictionaries
* Dictionaries of dictionaries...and so on

== Why all this is important to know?

* API reponses almost always have strcutured data
* API requests sometimes have strcutured data

== Tools to document JSON and XML

* Text editors of your choice, like Visual Studio Code

[.columns]
== JSON Basics

[.column.is-half]
.What is JSON?

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate.

[.column.is-half]
.Common Use Cases

JSON is widely used in web APIs for exchanging data, as developers can easily parse the data in almost any programming language.

== Basic data types in JSON

[.column]
* Strings: text inside double or single quotation marks
* Numbers: integer or floating, can be positive or negative
* Booleans: true or false
* Null: means nothing

=== Arrays
* Comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets
* Can have combination of any data types

> Example, [4, 7, 0, -9, -10] or ["blue", "red", "orange"] or ["56, "book", true, "name", 40]

=== Objects
* JSON's dictionaries enclosed in curly bracket
* Key value pair separated by commas
* Keys and values are separated by a colon
* Key and value can be of any data type

> Example, {"green": 46, "blue": 98, "pink": 45} or 

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
----

=== Nesting
Putting arrays and objects inside each other

[.column]
* Arrays inside objects
* Objects inside arrays
* Arrays inside Arrays
* Objects inside objects
